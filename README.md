# Full Stack MERN Blog App Example Project

## A fully functional example project showing how to create a blog application using the MERN stack and deploy it to a cloud platform!

This project demonstrates how to build a comprehensive blog application where users can authenticate, view, and upload posts. Every part of this project includes sample code to showcase the following:

* Create a responsive and dynamic blog platform using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack.
* Implement secure user authentication with JWT and bcrypt.
* Develop RESTful APIs with Express.js for CRUD operations.
* Manage data efficiently with MongoDB.
* Deploy the application to a cloud platform for high availability and scalability.

## Features

1. User Authentication: Secure user registration and login.
2. Viewing Posts: User-friendly interface to browse and read blog posts.
3. Uploading Posts: Authenticated users can create, edit, and delete their own posts, complete with image uploads and rich text formatting.
4. Backend Development: Robust RESTful APIs for seamless frontend-backend interaction.
5. Database Management: Efficient data storage, retrieval, and management with MongoDB.
6. Deployment: High availability and scalability ensured through cloud deployment.
Security Measures: Input validation, password hashing, and secure API endpoints.
